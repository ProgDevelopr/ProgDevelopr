💎🙂⚫ Hello, **I am PyDev!** I am a **data engineer** that likes messing with **🐘SQL**, **🐳Docker** and well... **🐍Python**!

🐘😥 Sadly, **psychopg2** projects will not be released publicly due to private info.

🏝️ I'm currently learning data engineering fundamentals, and I think I'm good at Python!

🪄 I make cool projects that can make certain tasks easier like math,science etc, along with other projects that are purely for fun! Can't forget that i also want to help data engineers out there!
Just call me he/him. (My projects are **open-source!**")

😊 My favourite project so far? It HAS to be **PY.cal**! And to make PY.cal and my other projects better, please tell me your **feedback** on my projects!

💡 Fun fact: I have a twin who likes Java development! Check out his profile here: https://github.com/nonscriptedd
